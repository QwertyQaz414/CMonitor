 * Common macro patterns:<br>
 * - Macros prefixed with an underscore must not be modified.
 * - Macros postfixed with an underscore are for internal usage.
 * - Macros prefixed and postfixed with a double underscore are header guards.
 * - Macros prefixed with '_C4C_SETTINGS_' can be defined before including the 
 *   header to enable some frequently used pattern.
 * - Files with the .inl extension are 'template' headers. Include them in the project,
 *   look at the end of those file and you'll see macros like '#undef C4C_PARAM_xxx' each
 *   with its own comment specifing what it does and what values you can put in (with some
 *   examples too). These macros must be correctly #defined before including the .inl file.
 * - Macros starting with 'C4C_' can be custom defined before including the .h file
 *   to customize their behaviour.
